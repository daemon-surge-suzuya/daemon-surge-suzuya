HI Hi Hi!! It's me, daemon-surge-suzuya! I have a real passion for Computer Science.
Right now, I'm learning about scapy and raw sockets in Python and C. 
If you happen to know of any projects where you think I could lend a hand or if you're looking for some assistance yourself,
feel free to reach out to me on Discord. My Discord ID is: its_daemon.
