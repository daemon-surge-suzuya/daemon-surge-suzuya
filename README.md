üëã Hey there! I am a computer networking enthusiast on a journey through the world of low-level programming. Currently, I'm honing my skills in Go, with plans to explore C and Rust in the near future.

üí° I find the intricacies of computer networks fascinating, and I'm passionate about delving into the nitty-gritty of protocols, packet handling, tinkering with hardware and systems programming.

üå± My roadmap is clear: Go -> C -> Rust. I'm diving into Go first, and I'm excited to uncover the power of this language for networking tasks. C and Rust are next on the list, as I explore the world of systems programming.

ü§ù If you happen to know of any projects where you think I could lend a hand or if you're looking for some assistance yourself, feel free to reach out to me on Discord. My Discord ID is: daemon_surge_suzuya
